# Ham_Radio_Symphony
# In spring, as the days lengthen, the morning light breaks and the dawn chorus symphony is performed by city birds looking for love...humans awaken not with birdsong, but with data pulses, push notifications and voices calling out through fibre and frequency - often searching for connection or companionship through the digital void. I have created a data-driven sound installation housed within a fabricated birdcage that plays a cybernetic dawn chorus symphony when there is active amateur radio activity. This draws a direct parallel between the instinctive calls of birds and the voices of humans reaching out into the radio spectrum, both of which are acts of curiosity, longing, and recognition â€” call signs cast into space.
